# Multi-module Maven project for Jakarta EE Pages 3.1

This test application has been derived from the Open Liberty guide for "Creating a multi-module application" that is available [here](https://openliberty.io/guides/maven-multimodules.html).

This application has been included in the Liberty Tools for IntelliJ repository as a reference to assist with development of features for multi-module Maven projects and is also intended for use in automated testing of those features. While support for multi-module Maven projects is still under development, Liberty Tools for IntelliJ may not behave as intended when interacting with this project.
